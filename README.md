# Gesture-Control-System

This application allows you to control your system thorugh gestures

## Work
This task can be done in two ways:-
1. Using only image processing - opencv
2. Training a neural network

There are some sample opencv files which showed some good results - cam.py, gesture.py, new.py. 

Run the first two simply using python3.

For new.py, please refer to this [repo](https://github.com/lzane/Fingers-Detection-using-OpenCV-and-Python)
